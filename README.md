## 📝 Project Overview: Stock Market Contest Platform  
**TRAZEX11** is a stock market contest platform where users **create virtual stock teams** instead of sports teams. It offers an interactive **fantasy stock market** experience, allowing users to participate in various contests, earn virtual coins, and compete with others.  

---  

## 🔥 Problem Statement  
Traditional stock market games focus on **simulated trading** or **real-money investments**. There is a lack of platforms that:  
1. **Gamify** stock market knowledge for beginners and enthusiasts.  
2. Allow users to **build stock-based teams** instead of individual trades.  
3. Offer a **fantasy sports-style competition** with **real-time stock data**.  

### 🚀 Existing Similar Solutions  
#### **Dream11 (Fantasy Sports)**  
- Users create teams with real players.  
- Lacks stock market involvement.  
- Based on sports events, not financial markets.  

#### **Stock Market Simulators**  
- Allow users to trade virtually but lack gamification.  
- No **team-based contests** or **leaderboard competitions**.

✔ **Daily, Weekly, and Special Contests** for stock enthusiasts.  
✔ **Virtual Team Creation** with **real-time stock data**.
